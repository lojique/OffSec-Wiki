# Service Scanning

## Nmap Scripts

Specifying `-sC` will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required. For example, in an assessment scope, we may be asked to audit a large Citrix installation. We could use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberstruggle/DeltaGroup/master/CVE-2019-19781/CVE-2019-19781.nse) `Nmap` script to audit for the severe Citrix NetScaler vulnerability ([CVE-2019–19781](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/01/17/active-exploitation-of-citrix-netscaler-cve-2019-19781-what-you-need-to-know/)), while `Nmap` also has other scripts to audit a Citrix installation.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ locate scripts/citrix

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers.nse
```

The syntax for running an Nmap script is `nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>`. `Nmap` scripts are a great way to enhance our scans' functionality, and inspection of the available options will pay dividends. Check out the [Network Enumeration with Nmap](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/19) module for a more detailed study of the `Nmap` tool.

## Attacking Network Services

### **Banner Grabbing**

As previously discussed, banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. Often a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initiated. Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>` is specified. We can also attempt this manually using `Netcat`. Let us take another example, using the `nc` version of `Netcat`:

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
```

This reveals that the version of `vsFTPd` on the server is `3.0.3`. We can also automate this process using `Nmap's` powerful scripting engine: `nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24`.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### **FTP**

It is worth gaining familiarity with FTP, as it is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data. A `Nmap` scan of the default port for FTP (21) reveals the vsftpd 3.0.3 installation that we identified previously. Further, it also reports that anonymous authentication is enabled and that a `pub` directory is available.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.253

Let us connect to the service using the `ftp` command-line utility.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ ftp -p 10.129.42.253

Connected to 10.129.42.253.

```

In the above shell, we see that FTP supports common commands such as `cd` and `ls` and allows us to download files using the `get` command. Inspection of the downloaded `login.txt` reveals credentials that we could use to further our access to the system.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ cat login.txt 

admin:ftp@dmin123
```

### **SMB**

SMB (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares, and some SMB versions may be vulnerable to RCE exploits such as [EternalBlue](https://www.avast.com/c-eternalblue). It is crucial to enumerate this sizeable potential attack surface carefully. <mark style="color:green;">`Nmap`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;"></mark> has many scripts for enumerating SMB, such as [smb-os-discovery.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html), which will interact with the SMB service to extract the reported operating system version.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-27 00:59 GMT

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.71 seconds
```

In this case, the host runs a legacy Windows 7 OS, and we could conduct further enumeration to confirm if it is vulnerable to EternalBlue. The Metasploit Framework has several [modules](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17\_010\_eternalblue/) for EternalBlue that can be used to validate the vulnerability and exploit it, as we will see in a coming section. We can run a scan against our target for this module section to gather information from the SMB service. We can ascertain that the host runs a Linux kernel, Samba version 4.6.2, and the hostname is GS-SVCSCAN.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ nmap -A -p445 10.129.42.253

### **Shares**

SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. Often these shares have files in them that contain sensitive information such as passwords. A tool that can enumerate and interact with SMB shares is [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html). The `-L` flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host, while `-N` suppresses the password prompt.

```shell-session
lojique@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	users           Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

This reveals the non-default share `users`. Let us attempt to connect as the guest user.

```bash
lobjique@htb[/htb]$ smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

Enter WORKGROUP\users's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*

smb: \> exit
```

The `ls` command resulted in an access denied message, indicating that guest access is not permitted. Let us try again using credentials for the user bob (`bob:Welcome1`).

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

Enter WORKGROUP\bob's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Feb 25 16:42:23 2021

  bob                                 D        0  Thu Feb 25 16:42:23 2021

smb: \> cd bob

smb: \bob\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Feb 25 16:42:23 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Feb 25 16:42:23 2021
  passwords.txt                       N      156  Thu Feb 25 16:42:23 2021

smb: \bob\> get passwords.txt 
getting file \bob\passwords.txt of size 156 as passwords.txt (0.3 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.3 KiloBytes/sec)
```

We successfully gained access to the `users` share using credentials and gained access to the interesting file `passwords.txt`, which can be downloaded with the `get` command.

### **SNMP**

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of <mark style="color:green;">`public`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;"></mark> and <mark style="color:green;">`private`</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;"></mark> are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments. Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.

```shell-session
lojique@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
```

```shell-session
lojique@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 

Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253
```

A tool such as [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the `dict.txt` file included in the GitHub repo for the tool.

```bash
lojique@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254
